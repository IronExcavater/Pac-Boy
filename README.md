### Game Boy Medieval Pac-Man

A Game Boy-styled, medieval-themed reimagining of the classic Pac-Man, developed as part of the [*Introduction to Computer Game Development*](https://handbook.uts.edu.au/subjects/31263.html) subject at UTS. This project combines nostalgic retro visuals with medieval themes, introducing fresh gameplay mechanics to the original game design.

## ðŸ“œ Project Motivation and Inspiration

This project was created to explore the recreation and innovation of classic Atari-era games. Inspired by the simplicity of Game Boy visuals and medieval lore, I aimed to give a unique twist to Pac-Man by designing custom sprites and textures and introducing new mechanics. Built in Unity, the game features original assets and coding implementations to enhance player experience, including AI adaptations and an inventive new ability.

## ðŸŒŸ Unique Features

1. **Medieval Theme in Game Boy Style**
   - Custom, Game Boy-inspired sprites and textures, with a medieval setting and character designs.
   
2. **Distinct Levels with Varied Mechanics**
   - **Level 1**: A rough recreation of the original Pac-Man, adapted to a medieval theme and limited by assessment specifications.
   - **Level 2**: Enhanced mechanics and visuals:
     - **Low Top-Down Perspective**: Revamped tile sprites with added stairs in the map center for an immersive look.
     - **Advanced Ghost AI**: Ghosts follow the original AI types but are more aggressive, adding to the challenge.
     - **Phase Ability**: Picking up a cherry grants a teleport ability, allowing the player to phase through nearby walls for tactical evasion. To use, press a movement key (W, A, S, D) toward the wall, then quickly press **Space** (while on the same tile).
